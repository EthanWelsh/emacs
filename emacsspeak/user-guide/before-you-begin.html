	install both. Most distributions come with Emacs, or you can
	download it from the Emacs home page at <A
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html</A

	If you have not already installed Emacspeak, you can download
	it from <A
HREF="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/</A
>. For Emacspeak installation
	information, please refer to the

			Lawrence Murphy,<A
HREF="http://emacspeak-guide.sourceforge.net/tutorial.html/"

>.
			Gary provides a lighthearted but thorough introduction to
			Emacs and Emacspeak, focusing on users who are
			not familiar with either application.  This
			introduction is
			recommend as a starting point, even before you
			do the Emacs tutorial (see next item).

>			"The (Official) Emacs Tutorial," by the Free
			Software Foundation. I call this the
			"official" tutorial because it is included
			with Emacs. To access this tutorial, start Emacs, then type <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>C-h
			t</B
> (Control h t).  This tutorial discusses the
			basic Emacs commands, including navigation,
			using Emacs as a text editor, and a bit about
			how Emacs works "under the hood." For
			new users this tutorial is strongly recommended, and
			even those users who are familiar with Emacs might find
			something they didn't already know.

><P
>	Emacs commands are denoted by holding down either the
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>Control</B
> key or the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>Meta</B
> key, then pressing one or
	more alphanumeric keys. On today's keyboards, the
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>Alt</B
> key provides the same functionality as
	the old <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>Meta</B
> key, or alternatively you can
	press the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>Esc</B
> key followed by the
	alphanumeric keys (you don't have to hold down the
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>Esc</B
> key). Because different documents
	sometimes use different notation to denote these sequences, this section
	explains the notation used in this HOWTO.  For consistency,
	this HOWTO uses the same notation as is used in the Emacs menus. 
	</P
><P
>	There are a few different types of key sequences you may
	see. The first is commonly written in the form <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>C-x
	C-s</B
>.  The letter "C," followed by a hypen, literally
	means "hold down the Control key" (the letter "M" would denote
	the Meta (Alt or Esc) key), and the additional letters denote
	specific commands.  This example, which saves the current
	file, should be interpreted as, "Hold down the Control key,
	press the letter x followed by the letter s, then release the Control key."
	</P
><P
>	Another common  sequence is written in the form <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>C-x
	d</B
>. Again, the letter "C" followed by a hyphen
	denotes holding down the Control key.  However, because the
	second letter of the sequence does not have a "C-" in front of
	it, you do not hold down the Control key while pressing the
	second letter. Thus, this command should be interpreted as,
	"Hold down the Control key and type x, then release the Control key and type d."
	Sometimes you may see commands with more than one letter after
	them, such as <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>C-e d w</B
>. The same rules
	apply: you should hold down the Control key, press "e,"
	release the Control key, then press "d" and "w". 
	</P
><P
>	Finally, you may see commands that use actual words, such as
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>M-x
	emacspeak-toggle-word-echo</B
>. Fortunately, most of
	these longer commands have a shorthand command (in this case,
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>C-e d w</B
>.  However, should you opt to type
	the entire command, you would hold down the Meta or Alt key,
	type x, release the Meta key, then type
	emacspeak-toggle-word-echo.
