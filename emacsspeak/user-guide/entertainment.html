>	One note about volume in <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>mpg123</SPAN
>: in
	my tests, I found that often the system volume would go way
	down when I started <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>mpg123</SPAN
>, to the
	point where I could barely hear it. If I exited
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>mpg123</SPAN
>, the volume in Emacspeak would continue
	to be extremely low, regardless of how it was set before I
	started <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>mpg123</SPAN
>.  However, if I
	turned up the volume while in
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>mpg123</SPAN
>, not only was it at an
	acceptable level in <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>mpg123</SPAN
>, it was
	also loud after I quit <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>mpg123</SPAN
>.
	</P
><P
>	Another problem that I noticed when using
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>mpg123</SPAN
> is that sometimes when you
	quit the application, it doesn't seem to relinquish control of
	the sound card. You'll see evidence of this behavior if you
	try to play a CD or restart <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>mpg123</SPAN
>
	- you'll get an error message saying that your sound card is
	busy or that it's not installed correctly. If you check the
	list of open Emacs buffers, you'll see that
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>mpg123</SPAN
> is still there, although
	it's apparently in a questionable state. I have not yet
	figured out how to remedy this problem; if anyone has any
	suggestions, please let me know so it can be added to the
	HOWTO.

>	If you find yourself listening to a lot of MP3s, there is an
	mp3 jukebox written by Karl Dahlke available at <A
HREF="http://www.eklhad.net/linux/app/jukebox"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.eklhad.net/linux/app/jukebox</A

	At the time of writing, the jukebox was in version 1.0.

>	If you want to rip your own MP3s, under Linux it is a
	two step process.  The first step is to convert the tracks on
	an audio CD to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.wav</TT
> format, then convert
	the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.wav</TT
> files to MP3s. There is a great
	web page by Nathan Robertson on how to do this, located at
