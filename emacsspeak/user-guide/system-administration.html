><P
>	Every time you log onto a Linux system, you must provide a
	password for your account. Occasionally you may wish to change
	your password, and many systems require that you do so regularly
	for added security.
	</P
><P
>	Changing your password is done in the Emacs shell. Normally,
	changing your password in the Emacs shell displays it on the
	screen and also speaks it aloud. However, Emacspeak adds a line to your
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.emacs</TT
> file that keeps Emacs from echoing
	your password either visually or orally. Of course, it's still
	a good idea to change your password in a secure area where
	no-one is likely to watch you type it in. To change your
	password:

			<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>passwd</B
>. You will be prompted for both your
			current password and your new password. 
			</P
></LI
></OL
><P
>	Note that some systems require passwords to be a certain
	length or contain certain characters such as numbers. If your
	password entry is rejected for some reason, keep trying.  In general,
	most 6-8 letter passwords that contain at least one number
	work well. Of course, be sure it's easy for you to remember!

>4.2.1. About Emacs applications</A
></H3
><P
>	As an Emacs user, you can
	mentally divide applications into two categories: those
	that are native to Emacs (that is, those applications written
	specifically for Emacs),
	and those that are not (for example, command-line applications). If an application is not
	Emacs-native, you can still run it from the Emacs shell
	command line.  To run the application, type the command
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>M-x shell</B
> to start the shell then the appropriate command to start the
	application. If the application is native to Emacs, you can
	type <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>M-x name-of-application</B
> to start the
	application. The application will run directly in the Emacs
	buffer.
	</P
><P
>	Sometimes, even though an application wasn't designed
	specifically for Emacs, you can install a special wrapper
	file that makes Emacs think the application is Emacs-native. These
	special files have a <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.el</TT
>, or
	Emacs-lisp, extension. After you've downloaded and
	installed a new application, if a <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.el</TT
> file exists for it, you
	can download that file too.  Place it in the correct
	directory, add the appropriate line to your
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.emacs</TT
> file so that Emacs will recognize
	the application, and
	you'll be able to run the application as if it were native to Emacs.  
	</P
><P
>	As an Emacspeak user, you'll also want to know which
	applications are Emacspeak-enabled. These Emacspeak-enabled applications have a second
	special <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.el</TT
> wrapper file that contains Emacspeak-specific commands that provide
	audio feedback just for that application. For a complete list
	of Emacspeak-enabled applications, see <A
HREF="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/applications.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/applications.html</A
>.
	All avaliable <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>emacspeak-*.el</TT
> files are
	included with Emacspeak, so you won't have to download them.
	</P
><P
>	So, when you install a new application,
	you'll need the following three things:
	</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>				The application.
				</P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>				A <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

				that application, if you want to run
				it directly from Emacs instead of from
				the Emacs shell command line.
				</P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>				An
				<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>emacspeak-*.el</TT
>
				file for the application, if you want
				to run it directly from Emacs and have
				it Emacspeak-enabled. Check
				in the /emacspeak/lisp directory
				to see if one exists for your
				application.
				</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>	Whenever possible, this HOWTO tells you specifically
	whether or not an application is Emacs-native, and if not,
	where to get the special <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.el</TT
> wrapper files if they are
	available.

	<SPAN

>FTP</SPAN

	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>wget</SPAN

	application, since most of them are distributed only on the

	or "period" in the file name) that denotes what type of file it
	is. If your file has a .gz or .tar extension, refer to <A
HREF="system-administration.html#UNCOMPRESSING-FILES"

></H3
><P
>	Most files are compressed in at least one (and
	sometimes multiple) ways. You can tell how a file was
	compressed, and thus how to uncompress it, by the extensions
	on the file.  The most common extensions are .tar and .gz,
	though there are others.
	</P
><P
>	If your downloaded file has multiple extensions, you'll have
	to uncompress it one step at a time, uncompressing the last
	extension first.  For example, if the file is named

CLASS="COMMAND"
>tar</B

>NOTES</TT

	among others. These files usually include instructions for
	installing that specific application. As each application may
	have a different installation process, you should read these

	probably need to be the root user to actually install any
