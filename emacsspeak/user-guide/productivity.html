></H2
><P
>	Emacs has a built-in desk calendar that includes a diary for
	planned events. The calendar and diary support both US and
	European date formats, but default to the US format. The diary
	keeps track of appointments and reminders using a diary file, a text file that contains a list of events and their
	dates. You can have Emacs send you an email every day with
	your schedule, or you can look at the calendar to view the
	day's events.
	</P
><P
>	To start the calendar application, use the
	command <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>M-x calendar</B
>. Calendar navigation
	commands are, for the most part, identical to text navigation
	commands, and you can also use the arrow keys to navigate.
	</P
><P
> 	If you'd like to use the diary, you need to create a diary
	file that contains your events.  The diary file is a simple text file,
	and, by default, Emacs uses <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>~/diary</TT
> as the
	diary file. Although you'll need to create the file manually,
	there are commands that allow you to add, view, and change
	diary entries. Most of these commands are Emacspeak-enabled.

	message the first time you do this that says, "No buffer named *Fancy
	Diary Entries*." This error message was reported as a bug to
	the bug-gnu-emacs mailing list by Tim Hesterberg.
	However, the command does in fact work, so you can just ignore
	the error message. By default, you'll be e-mailed the
	calendar entries for the next seven days.  Also, when you
	enter Emacs it will automatically show you the calendar
	entries for the next seven days. According to the GNU Emacs
	Manual, there is a way to change the
	number of days the email covers, but according to Tim that
	feature also has bugs and doesn't seem to work. At the time of writing, these problems have not been
	addressed.

>	If you're writing a document that will be read online, you have several
	choices: HTML, SGML, and XML, to name a few. Emacs comes with
	a built-in HTML editor, called
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>html-mode</SPAN
>. This editor provides you with
	additional commands for adding appropriate HTML tags to your
	document. To start <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>html-mode</SPAN
>, type
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>M-x html-mode</B
>.
	</P
><P
>	If you do a lot of HTML coding, you may wish to use 
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>html-helper-mode</SPAN
>. This mode has a
	slightly different interface and many more features than
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>html-mode</SPAN
>. The home page for
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>html-helper-mode</SPAN
> is located at
	<A
HREF="http://www.santafe.edu/~nelson/tools/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.santafe.edu/~nelson/tools/</A
>. You can
	either download just the
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>html-helper-mode.el</TT
> file from <A
HREF="http://www.santafe.edu/~nelson/tools/html-helper-mode.el"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.santafe.edu/~nelson/tools/html-helper-mode.el</A
>,
	or you can download the entire distribution, including
	documentation, from <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.reed.edu/pub/src/html-helper-mode.tar.gz"
TARGET="_top"
>ftp://ftp.reed.edu/pub/src/html-helper-mode.tar.gz</A
>.
	Installation instructions for both of these options are located
	at the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>html-helper-mode</SPAN
> website at
	<A
HREF="http://www.gest.unipd.it/~saint/hth.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.gest.unipd.it/~saint/hth.html</A
>. 
	</P
><P
>	If you're authoring larger documents or want to author in
	SGML, the PSGML mode for Emacs is recommended. The home page
	for PSGML is located at <A
HREF="http://www.lysator.liu.se/projects/about_psgml.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.lysator.liu.se/projects/about_psgml.html</A
>.
	</P
><P
>	There's also an XML editor for Emacs, called
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>sxml-mode</SPAN
>.  The home page is
	located at <A
HREF="http://koala.ilog.fr/plh/sxml.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://koala.ilog.fr/plh/sxml.html</A
>. You must
	have a Java Virtual Machine, as well as PSGML 1.0.1 or better
	to run <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>sxml-mode</SPAN
>.  Complete
	instructions for downloading and installing are available on
	the web site.
