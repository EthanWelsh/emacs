></H2
><P
> 
	Many users are familiar with Emacs as a text editor and have
	used it extensively in that capacity.  But Emacs is not just a
	text editor -- it is actually a desktop, in some ways like the
	graphical desktops that many use today. As a
	desktop, Emacs comes with all kinds of built-in functions, much
	like the Windows &#8482; desktop, including an e-mail
	application, calendar/appointment program, cd-player, games,
	and more. And like Windows &#8482;, there are many additional
	applications that you can download and add to Emacs that
	expand its functionality -- web browsers, the LaTeX text
	editor, mp3 players, and others. Unlike Windows, all of these powerful
	tools are under the GPL (Gnu Public License), so you can use them free of charge.

>	For visually impaired users, adding Emacspeak to Emacs might
	be compared to adding Jaws to Windows, except that instead of
	simply reading the screen to you as a standard "screenreader"
	might do, Emacspeak treats speech as first-class
	output. Because Emacspeak interacts directly with Emacs instead of just being an add-on, it provides much more context-specific
	information about what is going on than a typical
	screenreader would. In addition, there are many special
	commands just for Emacspeak that enhance interaction with a variety
	of Emacs applications.

NAME="ABOUT-THIS-TUTORIAL"
>2.2. About this tutorial</A
></H2
><P
>	Because Emacs and Emacspeak are unlike any environments you
	may have used before, it helps to know a little bit about how
	they work. This tutorial assumes that you have either used and
	are
	familiar with Emacs and Emacspeak or that you have completed some
	of the Emacs and Emacspeak tutorials. For a list of
	recommended tutorials, please refer to <A
HREF="before-you-begin.html#GETTING-STARTED"
>Section 3.1</A
>.
	</P
><P
>	This tutorial is organized by task and sub-task.  For example,
	the Internet section contains sub-sections on browsing the
	Internet, using email, chatting online, and other tasks. The
	File Manipulation section contains information on downloading
	and installing files, finding files, etc. For a complete
	listing of the available tasks, refer to the table of contents.
	</P
><P
>	Within this tutorial, you will find references to a number of
	Emacspeak-enabled applications, some that are included within
	the Emacs application, and some that are add-ons and must
	be downloaded.  Please note that the applications listed in
	this tutorial should not be considered a complete collection of applications but only a
	small subset. The complete list of Emacspeak-enabled
	applications is available at <A
