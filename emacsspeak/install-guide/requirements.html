>	There are a number of things you must have before you install
	Emacspeak, including Linux, a Linux-compatible sound card,
	Emacs, and a
	hardware or software speech synthesizer. You should read this section
	carefully before installing Emacspeak, because Emacspeak will not function correctly
	if any of the requirements are missing.

HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/INFO-SHEET.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/INFO-SHEET.html</A

	It provides an introduction to Linux,
	discusses some hardware requirements, and also has a section on
	how to obtain Linux.
	</P
><P
>	There are a number of different Linux
	distributions (distros) that you can choose from. All of the
	distros are based upon
	the same basic Linux code, or kernel, but each distro has a different
	installation process,
	features, and support options. Martin Wheeler's "Distributions
	HOWTO," at <A
HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Distributions-HOWTO/index.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Distributions-HOWTO/index.html</A

	discusses the pros and cons of a number of Linux distros.
	You can also find information about each distribution on
	their respective web sites. Those distros known to support
	Emacspeak are listed below with their URLs:

>	All of the distributions listed above can be downloaded free of charge
	from their respective web sites. However, the downloads are quite large,
	so you'll need a fast Internet connection. You will also need
	access to a CD burner, to burn your own CDs
	from the images you download. Depending on the distribution,
	you may also have to download and make a boot floppy. Once you
	have burned the CDs and created the boot floppy, you can
	install Linux.  Alternatively, you can purchase the
	disks at your local computer store for between $30 and $80
	US. Both of these options are discussed at length in the Linux
	Installation HOWTO at <A
HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Installation-HOWTO/overview.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Installation-HOWTO/overview.html</A
>,
	so you may want to refer there before making a decision as to
	which route to take.
	</P
><P
>	Most methods of installation require sighted assistance.
	However, if you prefer to install Linux yourself, there are
	two options.  The first is to install Linux from a DOS machine
	running JAWS. This option requires two machines, a null modem
	cable, JAWS for DOS, and a hardware speech
	synthesizer. More information on this option can be found
	in <A
HREF="appendixa.html"
>Section 8</A
>, Appendix A.  The
	second option is installing one of the distributions that
	includes a Speakup kernel patch.  This option requires a Speakup-enabled
	distro and a hardware synthesizer. Speakup is a screen reader
	that is patched into the kernel, so it starts talking
	at boot and will speak during the entire installation. Currently,
	Speakup is supported on Debian, Red Hat 7.1, and Slackware.
	The Speakup option also requires you to download the CD images and make your own CDs.
	Refer to the Speakup home page at <A
HREF="http://www.linux-speakup.org"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.linux-speakup.org</A
> for
	instructions for this option.
	</P
><P
>	For assistance with installing Linux, Eric Raymond's Linux
	Installation HOWTO, at <A
HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Installation-HOWTO"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Installation-HOWTO</A
>,
	is highly recommended reading.
	In the HOWTO, Eric discusses hardware requirements, choosing a
	distro, and installing your distro of choice. If Eric's HOWTO
	does not provide enough installation-specific information,
	you can refer to the documentation specific to your
	distribution, available at the URLs given in the distro list.

NAME="EMACS"
>4.2. Emacs</A
></H2
><P
>	Because Emacspeak is an Emacs subsystem, you must have Emacs
	installed for Emacspeak to work.  Most distributions include Emacs by
	default, so it should be installed on your system when you
	install Linux. 
	</P
><P
>	If you do not have Emacs on your system or you want to check on the latest version of Emacs, refer to
	the Emacs homepage at <A
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html</A
>.
	If you install Emacs on your own or choose to upgrade, be sure
	to install all of Emacs, including both the X and non-X
	versions (even if you do not plan to use X). Some Emacs
	applications depend on packages included in the X version,
	even if you use those applications in the non-X version of Emacs.
	</P
><P
>	If you would like to learn more about Emacs and how to use it,
	an excellent place to start is the Emacs Beginner's HOWTO, by
	Jeremy D. Zawondy.  It's available at <A
HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Emacs-Beginner-HOWTO.html"

><P
>	To produce speech output, you need two things: something to parse the
	information on the screen (Emacspeak), and something to
	produce the sounds you hear as output (a speech synthesizer).
	Emacspeak can use either a hardware or software synthesizer to
	produce sound output.  Software
	synthesizers have the benefit of being either free or very
	inexpensive. Hardware synthesizers can run from $150 to $1600
	or more, but they are typically easier to install than
	software synthesizers.

	make sure your sound card is Linux compatible. In addition, if
