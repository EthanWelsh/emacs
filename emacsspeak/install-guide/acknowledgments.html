><P
>	As with any effort for the Linux project, there are a number of
	people who contributed to this HOWTO in a roundabout way.
	Without their help, this document would not exist.
	</P
><P
>	Mr. James Van Zandt, the original author of the Emacspeak
	HOWTO. He graciously allowed me maintainership of the original
	HOWTO,
	which has been reworked into this document, "The Emacspeak Installation HOWTO."
	</P
><P
>	Dr. T.V. Raman, who always answered my Emacspeak questions, no matter how
	odd.
	</P
><P
>	Marty Moore, who provided a list of instructions for
	installing Emacspeak and ViaVoice under Mandrake. Many of Marty's
	instructions were used to make this document more complete.
	</P
><P
>	Tim Cross also deserves recognition, as he clarified several
	points in Marty's instructions, and some of Tim's comments are
	also used in this document. Tim also provided excellent
	explanations for the libXm.so.1 error message, as well as the
	"process speaker not running" error message.
	</P
><P
>	All the folks on the Emacspeak and blinux mailing lists who
	contributed suggestions, answered my questions, and gently
	showed me the errors in my ways.
	</P
><P
>	Throughout this document, I have tried to give
	credit to other authors when referring to their work. If I
	missed a citation, please let me know and I will be sure to
	correct it. If you did the work, you certainly deserve the
	credit!
