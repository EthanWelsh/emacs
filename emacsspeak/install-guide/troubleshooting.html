>The volume on my system is very low -
			how can I increase it?</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>					The easiest way to turn up
					system volume is with a set of
					speakers. However, sometimes
					speakers aren't feasible (for
					example, with a laptop), or
					even with speakers, the
					volume is still not loud
					enough. In this case, you can
					use the application
					<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>aumix</SPAN
>
					to increase your system's volume. 
					</P
><P
>					<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Aumix</SPAN
>
					comes with many distributions
					of Linux, but if your distro
					doesn't have
					<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>aumix</SPAN
>,
					you can download it from
					<A
HREF="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/aumix/aumix-2.7.tar.gz"
TARGET="_top"
>http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/aumix/aumix-2.7.tar.gz</A
>.
					The latest version is 2.7.
					</P
><P
>					To use
					<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>aumix</SPAN
>
					to increase your system's
					volume, type the command
					<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>aumix -v
					+100</B
> or
					<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>aumix -w +100</B
>.  The numerical
					value is the percentage
					volume, so in this case 100
					means 100%.  You may want to
					try different settings to find
					the most comfortable one for
					you. 
					</P

></DT
><DD
><P
>					If sndconfig doesn't recognize
					your soundcard, you should see
					if you can
					download a driver for your
					card.  The Advanced Linux
					Sound Architecture (ALSA) web
					site, located at <A
HREF="http://www.alsa-project.org"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.alsa-project.org</A
>,
					lists many sound
					cards, along with their
					drivers (if
					available).  Another alternative is
					the Open Sound System (OSS)
					for Linux. OSS is a
					commercial implementation of
					the Linux kernel drivers, and
					a list of supported cards can
					be found at <A
HREF="http://www.4front-tech.com/osshw.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.4front-tech.com/osshw.html</A

>When I try to install the ViaVoice RTK

></DT

><P
>					The file
					<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>libXm.so.1</TT
>
					is part of the
					<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>lesstif</TT
>
					distribution, and it is also a
					shared library. This error
					message indicates that either
					<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>lesstif</TT
>
					is not installed, or that the
					system is unable to locate the
					file. Often shared libraries
					are referenced by a
					symbolic link to the real
					shared library file, which may
					be named something like
					<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>libXm.so.1.0.17</TT
>.
					When the name of the symbolic
					link to the shared library and the
					name of the real shared
					library file differ,
					the system may not be able to
					find the shared library, even
					if it exists. If another
					program depends on a shared
					library that cannot be found,
					an error message like the one
					above results. In the case of
					<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>libXm.so.1</TT
>,
					lesstif is only needed for
					graphical demonstration
					programs.  Thus, if you do not
					plan to use the graphical
					mode, it is safe to install the
					ViaVoice RTK rpm using the option
					<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>--nodeps</B

					which tells ViaVoice to ignore any
					missing dependencies.
