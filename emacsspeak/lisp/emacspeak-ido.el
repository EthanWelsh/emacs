;;{{{  Introduction:

;;; Commentary:

;;; speech-enable ido.el
;;; This is an interesting task since most of the value-add
;;; provided by package ido.el  is visual feedback.
;;; Speech UI Challenge: What  is the most efficient means of
;;; conveying a dynamically updating set of choices?
;;; current strategy is to walk the list using c-s and c-r as
;;; provided by ido
;;; Set number matches shown to 3 using Custom so you dont hear
;;; the entire list.
