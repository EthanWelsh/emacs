@node emacspeak-advice Options
@section emacspeak-advice Options

Commentary:
This module defines the advice forms for making the core of Emacs speak
Advice forms that are specific to Emacs subsystems do not belong here!
I violate this at present by advising completion comint and
shell here.

Note that we needed to advice a lot more for Emacs  19 and
Emacs 20 than we do  for Emacs 21 and Emacs 22.
As of August 2007, this file is being purged of advice forms
not needed in Emacs 22.
This also means that this and subsequent versions of
Emacspeak should not be run on versions of Emacs older than
Emacs 21,
And preferably only run on Emacs 22.
This version of Emacspeak is only tested on Emacs 22.

@section emacspeak-epub Options

Commentary:
In celebration of a million books and more to read from
Google Books
The EPubs format is slightly simpler than full Daisy ---
(see) emacspeak-daisy.el
Since it only needs one level of indirection (no audio,
therefore no smil). This module is consequently simpler than
emacspeak-daisy.el.
This module will eventually  implement the Google Books  API
--- probably by invoking the yet-to-be-written gbooks.el in emacs-g-client
As we move to epub-3, this module will bring back audio layers etc., perhaps via a simplified smil implementation.

@node emacspeak-pronounce Options
@section emacspeak-pronounce Options

Commentary:
This module implements user customizable pronunciation dictionaries
for emacspeak. Custom pronunciations can be defined per file, per
directory and/or per major mode. Emacspeak maintains a persistent
user dictionary upon request and loads these in new emacspeak
sessions. This module implements the user interface to the custom
dictionary as well as providing the internal API used by the rest
of emacspeak in using the dictionary.
Algorithm:

The persistent dictionary is a hash table where the hash keys are
filenames, directory names, or major-mode names. The hash values
are association lists defining the dictionary. Users of this module
can retrieve a dictionary made up of all applicable association
lists for a given file.

@node emacspeak-sounds Options
@section emacspeak-sounds Options

Commentary:
This module provides the interface for generating auditory icons in emacspeak.
Design goal:
1) Auditory icons should be used to provide additional feedback,
not as a gimmick.
2) The interface should be usable at all times without the icons:
e.g. when on a machine without a sound card.
3) General principle for when to use an icon:
Convey information about events taking place in parallel.
For instance, if making a selection automatically moves the current focus
to the next choice,
We speak the next choice, while indicating the fact that something was selected with a sound cue.
 This interface will assume the availability of a shell command "play"
that can take one or more sound files and play them.
This module will also provide a mapping between names in the elisp world and actual sound files.
Modules that wish to use auditory icons should use these names, instead of actual file names.
As of Emacspeak 13.0, this module defines a themes
architecture for  auditory icons.
Sound files corresponding to a given theme are found in
appropriate subdirectories of emacspeak-sounds-directory

@section voice-setup Options

Commentary:
A voice is to audio as a font is to a visual display.
A personality is to audio as a face is to a visual display.

Voice-lock-mode is a minor mode that causes your comments to be
spoken in one personality, strings in another, reserved words in another,
documentation strings in another, and so on.

Comments will be spoken in `emacspeak-voice-lock-comment-personality'.
Strings will be spoken in `emacspeak-voice-lock-string-personality'.
Function and variable names (in their defining forms) will be
 spoken in `emacspeak-voice-lock-function-name-personality'.
Reserved words will be spoken in `emacspeak-voice-lock-keyword-personality'.

To make the text you type be voiceified, use M-x voice-lock-mode.
When this minor mode is on, the voices of the current line are
updated with every insertion or deletion.

How faces map to voices: TTS engine specific modules e.g.,
dectalk-voices.el and outloud-voices.el define a standard set
of voice names.  This module maps standard "personality"
names to these pre-defined voices.  It does this via special
form def-voice-font which takes a personality name, a voice
name and a face name to set up the mapping between face and
personality, and personality and voice.
Newer Emacspeak modules should use voice-setup-add-map when
defining face->personality mappings.
Older code calls def-voice-font directly, but over time those
calls will be changed to the more succinct form provided by
voice-setup-add-map. For use from other modules, also see
function voice-setup-map-face which is useful when mapping a
single face.
Both voice-setup-add-map and voice-setup-map-face call
special form def-voice-font.

Special form def-voice-font sets up the personality name to
be available via custom.  new voices can be defined using CSS
style specifications see special form defvoice Voices defined
via defvoice can be customized via custom see the
documentation for defvoice.
