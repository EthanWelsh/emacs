;;; Commentary:

;; google-this is a package that provides a set of functions and
;; keybindings for launching google searches from within emacs.

;; The main function is `google-this' (bound to C-c / g). It does a
;; google search using the currently selected region, or the
;; expression under point. All functions are bound under "C-c /"
;; prefix, in order to comply with emacs' standards. If that's a
;; problem see `google-this-keybind'. To view all keybindings type "C-c
;; / C-h".
;;
;; If you don't like this keybind, just reassign the
;; `google-this-mode-submap' variable.
;; My personal preference is "C-x g":
;;
;;        (global-set-key (kbd "C-x g") 'google-this-mode-submap)
;;
;; Or, if you don't want google-this to overwrite the default ("C-c /")
;; key insert the following line BEFORE everything else (even before
;; the `require' command):
;;
;;        (setq google-this-keybind (kbd "C-x g"))
;;

;; To start a blank search, do `google-search' (C-c / RET). If you
;; want more control of what "under point" means for the `google-this'
;; command, there are the `google-word', `google-symbol',
;; `google-line' and `google-region' functions, bound as w, s, l and space,
;; respectively. They all do a search for what's under point.

;; If the `google-wrap-in-quotes' variable is t, than searches are
;; enclosed by double quotes (default is NOT). If a prefix argument is
;; given to any of the functions, invert the effect of
;; `google-wrap-in-quotes'.

;; There is also a `google-error' (C-c / e) function. It checks the
;; current error in the compilation buffer, tries to do some parsing
;; (to remove file name, line number, etc), and googles it. It's still
;; experimental, and has only really been tested with gcc error
;; reports.

;; Finally there's also a google-cpp-reference function (C-c / r).

;;; Instructions:

;; INSTALLATION

;;  Make sure "google-this.el" is in your load path, then place
;;      this code in your .emacs file:
;;		(require 'google-this)
;;              (google-this-mode 1)

;;; Change Log:
;; 1.8   - 20131031 - Customizable mode-line indicator (credit https://github.com/mgalgs)
;; 1.7.1 - 20130917 - google-this-parse-and-search-string returns what browse-url returns.
;; 1.7   - 20130908 - Removed some obsolete aliases.
;; 1.7   - 20130908 - Implemented google-lucky-and-insert-url, with keybinding.
;; 1.7   - 20130908 - Implemented google-lucky, with keybinding.
;; 1.6   - 20130822 - Activated google-instant, so you can navigate straight for the keyboard
;; 1.5   - 20130718 - added keybinding for google region.
;; 1.5   - 20130718 - Fixed cpp-reference.
;; 1.4   - 20130603 - Added parent groups.
;; 1.4   - 20130603 - Renamed some functions and variables. Is backwards incompatible if you were using functions you shouldn't be.
;; 1.4   - 20130603 - Fixed quoting.
;; 1.3   - 20130531 - Merged fix for google-forecast. Thanks to ptrv.
;; 1.3   - 20130531 - More robust google-translate command.
;; 1.2.1 - 20130426 - Created an error parser for the google-error function.
;; pre   - 20130227 - It works with c-like errors and is extendable to other types of errors using the varible `google-error-regexp'.
;; 1.2.1 - 20130426 - autoloaded any functions that the user might want to call directly.
;; 1.2   - 20130421 - Fixed docs.
;; pre   - 20130504 - Changed the keybinding to be standards compliant.
;; pre   - 20130303 - Fixed problem with backslash.
;; pre   - 20130227 - Added support for google-translate and google-maps packages.
;; pre   - 20130227 - And added `google-forecast' function.
;; pre   - 20130227 - And added `google-location-suffix' so we're not constrained to google.com anymore.
