;;; Commentary:

;; This script provides functionality for automatically updating your Emacs
;; packages periodically. It is specially usefull for people that work in
;; multiple machines and tend to forget to manually update packages from time to
;; time. The periodicity of the update is given by the custom variable
;; `auto-package-update-interval'.
;;
;;; Change Log:
;;
;; 1.2 - Refactor for independency on package-menu functions.
;; 1.1 - Support GNU Emacs 24.3.
;; 1.0 - First release.

;;; Code:
(require 'dash)

(require 'package)
(package-initialize)
